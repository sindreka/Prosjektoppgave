\section*{Summary and Conclusions}
Solving partial differential equations with finite difference methods often requires performing operations on huge linear systems. The Krylov projection method allows the user to choose the size of the linear system, making the method iterative. The Krylov projection method was tested on the heat equation against other methods in convergence, memory demand and computation time. The results shows that the Krylov projection method can reduce memory demand, and computation time if several processing units is used or some assumptions are met. No difference regarding convergence was found.
