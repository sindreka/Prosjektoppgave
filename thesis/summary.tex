\section*{Summary and Conclusions}
Solving partial differential equations with finite difference methods often requires performing operations on huge linear systems. The Krylov projection method can reduce the size of the linear system, thereby decreasing memory demand. In this text the Krylov projection method will be tested on the heat equation against other methods in convergence and computation time. The results point to a slight advantage for KPM in some cases, but is in general slower than other methods.
