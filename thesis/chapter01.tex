The aim of this report is to investigate how the Krylov projection method (KPM)  can be used to solve linear differential equations on the form $q'(t)=Aq(t)+f(t)$. These problems arise for example when discretizing time dependent, linear partial differential equations with the method of lines, and have therefore a wide range of applications. 
KPM is an orthogonal projection technique, the method is explained in detail in section \ref{sec:krylov}. See also \textit{A krylov projection method for systems of ODEs} by E. Celledoni and I. Moret ~\cite{elena} for more information about the method. \\

%We use Arnoldi's method which allows us to construct an orthonormal basis for a given Krylov subspace, this gives rise to two slightly different methods, presented in detail in section \ref{sec:fullKPM} and \ref{sec:rest} respectively.

In this report the heat equation will be solved with KPM, convergence and computational time will be compared with an alternative solution technique, the alternative will be presented in section \ref{sec:DM}.
The heat equation will be stated here with boundary conditions for future references. \\
%The heat equation is 
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:heat}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial u(t,x,y)}{\partial t} - \nabla^2 u(t,x,y) &= p(t,x,y) & t \in [0,T]\\
u(0,x,y) &= 0 \\
u & = 0 			&\text{ on } \partial [0,L] \times [0,L]
\end{aligned},
\end{equation}
$p(t,x,y)$ is a smooth function, and $u(t,x,y)$ is the solution sought.\\

Assume that the right hand side of equation \eqref{eqn:heat} is separable, so that $p(t,x,y) = f(t)g(x,y) $, how this problem can be solved if this is not the case will be explained in section \ref{sec:nonsep}.
Given the vector $v = [v_1,v_2, \cdots, v_m] \in \mathbb{R}^m $ with elements $ g(x_i,y_j)$, $x_i,y_j \in [0,L]$ and the matrix $A$ as an approximation of the Laplacian, the space-discrete version of the heat equation can be written as

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:numheat}
\begin{aligned}
q'(t) -Aq(t) &= f(t) v, \qquad & t \in [0,T] \\
q(0) &= 0               
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is an $m \times m$ matrix assumed to be time independent, $f(t)$ is continuous on $[0,T]$, $v \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $q(t)$ is the sought solution vector on $[0,T]$. Note also that $f(t)$ is a scalar function, so that $f(t) v = [f(t)v_1,f(t)v_2, \cdots,f(t) v_m] $.
The solution is 
\begin{equation*}
q(t) = \int \limits_0^t \exp(A(t-s))f(s)v ds
\end{equation*}
More details about $A$, $x_i$, $y_i$ and $q(t)$ will be given in section \ref{sec:imp}.
