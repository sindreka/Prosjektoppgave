We will in section \ref{sec:cc} and \ref{sec:mr} briefly compare the computational and memory costs of the different methods discussed.% This will be presented  respectivly.

\section{Computational complexity} \label{sec:cc}

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{r | l}
 Matrix vector multiplication & $\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ \cite{complex} \\
 Matrix inversion  & $ \mathcal{O}(m^3)$ \cite{complex} \\
 Arnoldi's algorithm & $ \mathcal{O}(n^2 m)$ \cite{numop} \\
 Integration & $\mathcal{O}(k)$
\end{tabular}
\caption{Computational complexity for some operations. Dimension of the matrices is assumed to be $m \times m$ while $n$ is the restart variable and $k$ is the number of steps in time.}
\label{tab:runtime}
\end{table}


All methods need to preform a matrix inversion, and $k$ matrix vector multiplication.
If KPM or KPM$(n)$ is used we need to use Arnoldi's algorithm, if $p$ is not separable we need to perform all operations mentioned $m$ times, instead of one. An overview over the computational cost of these operations is given in table \ref{tab:runtime}. A list of asymptotic computational complexity for the methods is given in table \ref{tab:cc}.
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l | l l}

Method & Separable $p$ & Non separable $p$ \\
\hline
 DM & $\mathcal{O}(km^2+m^3)$ & $\mathcal{O}(km^2+m^3)$  \\
 KPM& $\mathcal{O}(km^2 +m^3)$ & $\mathcal{O}(km^3 +m^4)$ \\
 KPM$(n)$& $\mathcal{O}((kn^2 +n^2m+n^3)\gamma)$  & $\mathcal{O}((kn^2m +n^2m^2+n^3m)\gamma)$
\end{tabular}
\caption{Computational complexity for the methods discussed, $\gamma$ denotes the number of restarts needed to converge.}
\label{tab:cc}
\end{table}

From table \ref{tab:cc} it is clear that KPM is not going to be the best, leaving
KPM$(n)$ to be the only method that can outperform DM, but it is difficult to say without knowing how $\gamma$ scales with $m$ and $n$. Notice that if $n = 1$ or $n = m$ then KPM and KPM$(n)$ have the same computational complexity if we assume $\gamma \propto m^2/n^2$.

\section{Memory requirement} \label{sec:mr}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
 $A$    & $ \sim 10 m$ \\
 $q$    & $ m\times k$ \\
 $P$ & $ m \times k$ \\
 $f$ & $ k $ \\
 $v$    & $ m$ \\
 $V_n$  & $ n \times n $ \\
 $H_n$  & $ n \times n $  \\
 Inverted matrix, with size $n \times n$ & $n \times n$ \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{List over number needed to store large variables.}
\label{tab:memreq}
\end{table}

All methods need to store $A$, $y$ and an inverted matrix. DM also need to store $P$. KPM and KPM$(n)$ need to remember $f$, $v$, $H_n$ and $V_n$. In addition KPM and KPM$(n)$ need to remember $P$ if $p$ is non separable. An overview over the memory requirement for the different variables is given in table \ref{tab:memreq}. A complete list over memory requirements for the methods is given in table \ref{tab:mr}. 
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l| l l}
Method & Separable $p$ & Non separable $p$ \\
\hline
DM & $m^2+2mk+10m$ & $m^2+2mk + 10 m$ \\
KPM & $mk+3m^2+11m+k$ & $2mk+3m^2+11m+k$ \\
KPM$(n)$ & $ mk +2n^2+k+11m+nm $ &  $ 2(mk + n^2)+k+11m+nm $
\end{tabular}
\caption{Memory requirements for the methods discussed. The values are not given asymptotically to make it easier to distinguish between the different methods.}
\label{tab:mr}
\end{table}
From table \ref{tab:mr} it is clear that KPM$(n)$ requires the least amount of memory of the three if $n$ is small. Small $n$ is the key, if $n$ is to big we just have KPM, which uses the largest amount of memory of the three. DM is somewhere in the middle, depending on $n$.
